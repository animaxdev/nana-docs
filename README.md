Contributed by qPCR4vir
## A doxygen "offline" documentation. Build instructions:

 1- Install [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html)
 
 2- Alongside with the folder of nana unzip or clone the repository [nana-docs](https://github.com/cnjinhao/nana-docs)
 
 3- and unzip or clone the repository for [nana-demo](https://github.com/qPCR4vir/nana-demo) 
 
 4- run doxygen with one of the .doxyfile projects provided in [nana-docs](https://github.com/cnjinhao/nana-docs)
 
 5- open and bookmark the locally generated web site.

# Documenting nana

1. [Reference Manuals](http://nanapro.org/en-us/documentation/) by Jin Hao.
2. [This Nana automatic documentation project](https://github.com/cnjinhao/nana-docs).  [See an example here](http://qpcr4vir.github.io/nana-doxy/html/index.html). To contribute:  
  * fork [nana](https://github.com/cnjinhao/nana), directly edit doxygen comments in the source code and make a pull request to hotfix.     
  * fork [nana-docs](https://github.com/cnjinhao/nana-docs) or [nana-docs-fork](https://github.com/qPCR4vir/nana-docs) and edit doxygen sources and request a pull. You can modify the .md files in this repository (for example: [Getting Started](https://github.com/qPCR4vir/nana-docs/blob/master/source/02-Getting%20Started.md). One of the possibilities: in your fork of nana-docs you edit the file and make a pull request).  
  * fork [nana-demo](https://github.com/qPCR4vir/nana-demo) and pull your own examples.  
This is the information you will see in the Doxygen generated docs, that you can generate locally for your very personal branch and have it available off-line, or that you can navigate at [Nana Doxy Docs online](http://qpcr4vir.github.io/nana-doxy/html/index.html).
